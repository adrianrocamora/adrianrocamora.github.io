Here's a link to my \"techie\" resume:  ___  I hold a Summa cum Laude BS in Mechatronics Engineering and a Masters in Biomedical Engineering. I worked as a researcher at USC during my PhD in Neuroscience where I focused on designing, simulating and implementing a variety of algorithms on robotic systems as well as cadavers for research in Neuromuscular Biomechanics. I later worked at Vidrio Technologies LLC creating laser microscopy and image analysis software for Neuroscience. I also worked at Fitch Solutions where I delivered high-stake, financial features to our clients using a broad variety of technologies.   I currently work as a Researcher at The Veidt Initiative, where I focus on Optimized Human Learning, Biomedical Engineering Applications and Computational Neuroscience. My preferred weapons of choice are currently Python and C++17.",
