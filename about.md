I started this blog on 2018-03-13 so that I'd have a place to dump short essays on topics that
seem to come up a lot in discussion about C++. I might occasionally say things that aren't
about C++, too.

### My Actual Publications

I have also produced some longer-form content.

* I speak regularly at CppCon and C++Now; these videos are collected on YouTube. [(Playlist.)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXTVlgmc2KcD3mgkZfrq3jJl8RNaAz-lp)
