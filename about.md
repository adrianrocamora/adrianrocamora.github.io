I started this blog on 2019-02-10 so that I can share some ideas and prototypes with my friends
or anyone that happens to find my ramblings interesting.

There's a variety of topics I want to write about. Among them: mathematics, robotics, drawing, 
music, computer vision, linguistics, philosophy, writing, neuroscience and data science. I'll 
be using tags so it's a bit easier to find posts by topic.

Well, I hope you enjoy your stay!

### My Projects

* I'm a researcher and most of my work has been in: Computer Vision, Robotics, Neuromuscular Biomechanics and Computational Neuroscience
* I'm a techie. I worked for several years a Software Engineer (I still do), but I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a Master's in Biomedical Engineering and two unfinished Ph.D.'s (I'm working on it...)
* I'm an amateur mathematician fascinated with Number Theory
* I'm a musician (a bad one) and a digital artist (a worse one)
